# The purpose of the Read Only Areas (ROA) preference is to tell the Workgroup Manager to treat any parts or referenced assemblies retrieved from specified file system paths as objects that already exist in Windchill.
# When saving an assembly in Workspace, where components were retrieved from a ROA path, the behavior is as follows:
# Existing assembly components do not create incomplete objects even if they are not present in Workspace.
# If the user adds more components to the assembly from the ROA, an incomplete object for the new component will get added to the workspace, in which case the user needs to use REPLACE prior to Check In, to snap to the Windchill version.
# Note that adding components from the ROA is regarded as improper procedure - the user should be downloading components to Workspace if they intend to add them to the assembly, so creating an incomplete object is acceptable as this situation should not be seen very often.

# If the file extension is part of part number, it will be included as part of the instance name.
# * Yes - The instance name is updated if it is different from the part number.
# The instance name update occurs at different points depending on the document:
# --- For a new document that was created using a supported method and whose part number was manually changed in the properties, the instance name is updated immediately.
# --- For a document that was renamed or saved using the Save As action, the instance name is updated when the referencing document is opened in CATIA V5. The parent assembly of the renamed instances will be modified. Therefore, you must check the assembly back into Windchill to save the instance name update.
# This scenario applies only if the CAD Document Number system attribute is mapped to CAT:PART_NR.

#           until the model is checked out or modified in session.
# * Legacy:
#     --- CATIA V5 CATParts: For legacy data, global attributes are updated according to the value of update.metadata.on.load. This
#           preference is applied only to documents that do not have a neutral data XML file (models upgraded from a release
#           prior to Windchill 9.0).
#     --- Inventor, NX, and SolidWorks: Legacy is equivalent to No.
# Note: For best performance, set update.metadata.on.load and force.update.metadata.on.open to No.

#     --- Note: If update.metadata.on.load=No, out-of-date metadata values are displayed in CATIA V5 for any CATIA V5 CATPart
#           that is not loaded in design mode.
# Note:
# * For best performance, set update.metadata.on.load and force.update.metadata.on.open to No.
# * If force.update.metadata.on.open=Yes, global attributes are updated for documents that are loaded in visualization mode,
#     regardless of the value of update.metadata.on.load.
# * When a drawing is loaded, metadata is updated for any CATIA V5 document that the drawing references with an attribute link,
#     regardless of the value of update.metadata.on.load.
#update.metadata.on.load=Yes

# This preference controls whether the conflict window is suppressed during an update action if the model is already loaded in a CAD session.
# If the conflict window is suppressed, the model in the CAD session is automatically updated even if it has been modified in session.

# Controls how contents are downloaded for CATIA V5 documents during operations such as Add to Workspace and Open in CATIA from the commonspace.
# * Full (default) - The full Windchill Workgroup Manager downloading behavior.
# All contents (primary content and secondary attachments) are added to the workspace, regardless of whether the cache is enabled in CATIA V5.
# * CGR - For *.CATPart and *.model document types, CGR files are downloaded along with secondary attachments.
# Primary content files (.CATPart and .model files) are not downloaded unless an operation requires the full content to be available in the workspace.
# * Async - For *.CATPart and *.model document types, CGR files are downloaded along with secondary attachments.
# Primary content files (.CATPart and .model files) are downloaded in the background when the Add to Workspace or Open in CATIA operation is finished.
# This setting has no effect on other document types that don't have CGR files, such as CATProduct, CATDrawing, CATProcess, CATCatalog, CATMaterial, CATAnalysis, and so on.
# For document types without CGR files, all contents (primary content and secondary attachments) are downloaded.
# For document types without CGR files, there is no difference between the Full, CGR, and Async options.

# Controls whether to download and load all associated 3D Models and update drawing views during publication of a drawing by a file synchronization worker.
# * Yes (default) - Downloads and loads all associated 3D Models with their required dependencies and also updates drawing views during publication of a drawing, by a file synchronization worker.
# * No - Prevents download of all 3D Models and also does not update the drawing views during publication of a drawing, by a file synchronization worker. The drawing views are published as displayed when checked in from CAD. Meta data update of a drawing is propagated during publication.
# Note: When this preference is set to 'No', the dependencies of CATDrawing are not downloaded during the drawing publication in File Sync enabled CATIA V5 worker.
# As a result, the attribute values in the drawing are controlled by external attribute links, for example, attributes of the CATPart or CATProduct associated with the CATDrawing are not updated during CATDrawing publication. 
# It means attribute values (both Windchill system parameters and IBAs) of the associated drawing model in the drawing title block may not be updated.
# Hence, such attribute values may be outdated in the Creo View representation.
#update.drawing.views.on.publish=Yes

# Controls whether metadata is updated during save actions.
